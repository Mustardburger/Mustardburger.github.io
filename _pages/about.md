I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Cincinnati majoring in Biomedical Engineering and minoring in Computer Science. I am currently interested in bioinformatics, computational genomics, and the applications of machine learning and deep learning in functional genomics. This constitutes my overall research direction of building AI systems for biomedical research and healthcare. \
Besides the academics, I'm an avid chess and badminton player, and I also play the guitar.
